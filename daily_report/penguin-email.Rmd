Good morning!

Here are the latest measurements on the penguin project. See the full details at the project dashboard here: <https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/shinypenguins/>

```{r echo=FALSE}
penguin_plot
```

Here's how the data looks thus far:

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species,
                 shape = species),
             size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","darkorchid","cyan4"))
```

Things are going swimmingly here. There are `r days_remaining` days remaining in the project with `r nrow(penguins)` measurements complete.

This project is making me hungry for popsicles.

Regards,

Katie
